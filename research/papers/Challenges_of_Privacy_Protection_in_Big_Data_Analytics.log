KEY POINTS :
1) Given a sufﬁcient dataset as basis, almost every single user of online services can be identiﬁed, leading to neatly tailored online services being provided
   to each individual. [1]
2) This paper, classifies data analysis into Verification, Identification and Priori.
		Verification, is when a data analyst intentionally shapes the data-set to a representation that best possibly provides the requested answer. 
		Identification, is when the data analyst gathers a large data-set, potentially from multiple sources, and tries to identify interesting facts hidden
	within the data-set.
		Lastly, Priori is when the data analyst has little or no information about interesting aspects of the dataset, but hopes to stumble over interesting
	statistical inferences.
3) Using an example of the AOL data attack in 2006, categorizes the attack into three sub-categories, namely Correlation attacks, Arbitrary Identiﬁcation attacks,
	and Targeted identiﬁcation attacks.
